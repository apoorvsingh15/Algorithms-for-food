# Algorithms for all

The sole reason for this repo is quick and effective learning. It is an initiative taken by two friends to make their miserable lives better through coding :p

# What to Expect

- Expect some badly coded algorithms which could prove to be essential for you if you can debug them :p
- The competetion expects us to deliver atleast one algorithm per week so you can expect intotal 2 algos from us.
- Actually, expect less as we are a touch lazy.
- The programming language will be mainly javascript, but we are free to deliver algos and code in any language of our choice.

# License

MIT license because why the hell not, but you can use the code anywhere you like, we are not going to claim anything.

# Contributing

Feel free to contribute but at your own risk. :p Just Kidding.
